I am a third year undergraduate student from China University of Petroleum (East China). In 2022, I was selected to enter the Science Experimental Class of the College of Science. After major streaming, I am now studying Electronic Information (Experimental) Engineering in the College of Marine Space and Information.

📖Education
======
2022.09-present  Undergraduate, China University of Petroleum (East China), Qingdao

💡Scientific Research Experience
======
· Adaptive Robust MIMO Radar Target Localization via Capped Frobenius Norm     2024.01-2024.07
  Aiming at the positioning failure problem of MIMO radar in Gaussian noise and impulsive noise scenarios, we break through the limitation of traditional algorithms of ‘single-scene dependence’, and propose an adaptive framework based on the Truncated Frobenius Paradigm Numbers (CFN) to achieve high-precision positioning in dual scenarios.
· Simulation and visualisation of ground wave radar systems for shipboard platforms   2023.10-present
  Aiming at the problem of radar detection performance degradation of shipborne mobile platforms under complex sea conditions, a multi-physics field coupling simulation system is constructed to realise the dynamic visualisation of the whole link of the ocean dynamic environment, ship movement and radar echo.
